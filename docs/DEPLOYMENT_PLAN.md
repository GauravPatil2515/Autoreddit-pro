   - Caching frequently used prompts
   - Token usage tracking and optimization

📊 PHASE 3: STREAMLIT UI ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------------------------

🎨 UI COMPONENTS:
1. **AI Configuration Panel**
   - Model selection dropdown (8B/70B/Scout)
   - Temperature and token sliders
   - Performance indicators (expected latency)
   - Cost tracking (free tier usage)

2. **Generation Interface**
   - Real-time preview of AI output
   - Side-by-side template vs AI comparison  
   - Edit and regenerate options
   - Batch generation for multiple subreddits

3. **Compliance Dashboard**

   - AI-powered rule interpretation
   - Automatic flair detection and application
   - Self-promotion ratio monitoring

2. **Content Quality Assurance**
   - Spam detection algorithms
   - Duplicate content prevention
   - Engagement prediction scoring

3. **Rate Limiting & Ethics**
   - Respect Reddit API limits
   - Implement posting delays
   - Community-first approach
